# NodeServer-Express-Static
This is a NodeJ based Server, on top we have used Express library to make my life easy. Also used Morgan library to log the various details such as request header, body etc.

Its very easy to create and setup node server.

1) First step is to intialize a Node project with 'npm init' command
2) Then, npm install Express
3) npm install morgan
4) In the index.js, just import the http, express and morgan
5) Instantiate http by passing express instance.
6) Create http server and listen to the post.

Thats it, your node js web server is ready. So cool na....
